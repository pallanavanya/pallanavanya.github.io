### Short bio

I am a determined and clear-minded law student with a special interest in litigation, public law, and legal research. In my practice placements with experienced lawyers, I have witnessed court processes, assisted in the drafting of legal documents, and supported interactions with clients. I am familiar with legal research platforms such as SCC Online and Manupatra. I am looking to become a lawyer for litigation and am keen on strategies for courtroom advocacy and improving my drafting skills.
